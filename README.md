## TODO List
- [ ] Release the VLA example and evaluation code


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (check [here](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/requirements.html) for more detailed requirements)

### Steps

1. Create a virtual environment with python 3.10:
    ```sh
    conda create -n vlnce-isaac python=3.10
    conda activate vlnce-isaac
    ```

2. Make sure that Isaac Sim is installed on your machine. Otherwise follow [this guideline](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html) to install it. If installing via the Omniverse Launcher, please ensure that Isaac Sim 4.1.0 is selected and installed. On Ubuntu 22.04 or higher, you could install it via pip:
    ```sh
    # use version 4.2.0.2 instead of 4.1.0 (tested on ubuntu 22.04)
    pip install isaacsim-rl==4.2.0.2 isaacsim-replicator==4.2.0.2 isaacsim-extscache-physics==4.2.0.2 isaacsim-extscache-kit-sdk==4.2.0.2 isaacsim-extscache-kit==4.2.0.2 isaacsim-app==4.2.0.2 --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

    # may need to run following if run into error later on
    sudo apt install --reinstall mesa-utils mesa-va-drivers libgl1-mesa-dri libglx-mesa0
    sudo prime-select nvidia
    glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"
    sudo reboot
    ```

3. Clone Isaac Lab and link the extensions.

    **Note**: This codebase was tested with Isaac Lab 1.1.0 and may not be compatible with newer versions. Please make sure to use the modified version of Isaac Lab provided below, which includes important bug fixes and updates. As Isaac Lab is under active development, we will consider supporting newer versions in the future.

    ```shell
    # clone THIS_REPO
    git clone git@github.com:zikuicai/VLN-CE-Isaac.git

    # Clone Isaac Lab and link the extensions
    git clone https://github.com/yang-zj1026/IsaacLab.git
    cd IsaacLab
    cd source/extensions
    ln -s {THIS_REPO_DIR}/isaaclab_exts/omni.isaac.vlnce .
    ln -s {THIS_REPO_DIR}/isaaclab_exts/omni.isaac.matterport .
    cd ../..
    ```

4. Run the Isaac Lab installer script and additionally install rsl rl in this repo.
    ```shell
    ./isaaclab.sh -i none
    ./isaaclab.sh -p -m pip install -e {THIS_REPO_DIR}/scripts/rsl_rl
    cd ..
    ```

## Data

Download the data from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhaojing/VLN-CE-Isaac) and put them under `isaaclab_exts/omni.isaac.vlnce/assets` directory.
The expected file structure should be like:
```graphql
isaaclab_exts/omni.isaac.vlnce
├─ assets
|   ├─ vln_ce_isaac_v1.json.gz
|   ├─ matterport_usd
```

## Code Usage

Run the demo with a PD path planner
```shell
python scripts/demo_planner.py --task=go2_matterport_vision --history_length=9 --load_run=2024-09-25_23-22-02

python scripts/demo_planner.py --task=h1_matterport_vision --load_run=2024-11-03_15-08-09_height_scan_obst
```
